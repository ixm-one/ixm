# Packages

Much like CMake, IXM provides custom `find_package` modules for third-party
software. Some of these `find_package` modules provide a great deal of
features, and their *components* will be documented on a per-page basis.

The packages documented here are either wrappers around existing CMake
`find_package` modules, modules to find on-disk targets such as libraries or
executables, or modules to create interface targets to set compiler options
without users having to do the hard work of managing flags themselves.
