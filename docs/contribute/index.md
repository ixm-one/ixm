# Contributing

First, thanks for the interest in contributing! Before you continue, please
make sure you've read the IXM project's [Code of Conduct][coc].

This section of the documentation is intended *specifically* for users who wish
to contribute their free time and labor to improving the IXM project. Here you
will find information on how IXM works internally, as well as information on
its infrastructure. It is important that contributors have at least a minimal
understanding of the infrastructure that IXM relies on, as this is necessary to
keep IXM from bitrotting.

This documentation is split up into 3 sections:

1. Project Internals
2. Project Infrastructure
3. Developer Experience

Each of these sections can be found in the sidebar.
