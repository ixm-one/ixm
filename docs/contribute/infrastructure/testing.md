# Testing

This section explains the (unfortunately complex) unit and integration tests
that IXM uses to validate *some* (but not all) of its features.

> [!NOTE]
> Although the API used for testing IXM is via `pytest` and a plugin, this
> capability leaves a lot to be desired and at some point a more dynamic system
> that integrates well with the rest of the JS tooling that IXM depends on will
> replace the current system.
