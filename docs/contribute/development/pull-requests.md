# Pull Requests

This section discusses steps necessary for contributors when filing a pull
request.

## GitHub Templates

Several templates are provided for users to more easily fill out their PR. Not
using these templates could delay your PR from being merged or even reviewed.

## Content

Pull request titles and their bodies are expected to conform to the
[Conventional Commits] specification. Automation is in place to ensure that
this convention is followed. Individual commits are *not* expected to follow
this convention, as only the PR title and its body are used when merging into
`main`.

Automation is in place to enforce IXM's specific verbs and scopes before
merging.
